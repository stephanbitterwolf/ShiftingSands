Hello and thank you for your kind attention,

The analyses process of the Shifting Sands Paper took me a many years to complete and is partly documented in this github repository. 

The 0_data folder contains all of the raw data used.
The 1_code folder contains all of the r code used to analyze the raw data.

If you are interested in specific figures or datasets please get in contact with me (sbitterw@ucsc.edu) or attempt running the R code on your computer.

Thanks and best of luck with your endeavours.
